# BattleSizeResized

BattleSizeResized is a mod for MountnBlade II: Bannerlord. Allows battle sizes up to 2040 units by modifying the original UI. Also, dinamically sets initial spawn numbers to avoid crashes from engine agent limits.

This module was originally part of the Vanguard Overhaul, planned to be an esclusive feature, but I've decided to take the time before War Sails to test it with a large number of people.
